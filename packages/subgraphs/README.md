# Celo Composer Subgraph

## Requirements

-   [The graph cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/graph-cli)

Run

```bash
graph codegen
```

-   Create an account at https://thegraph.com/hosted-service.
    -   Find more information about deploying a subgraph to the hosted service on the Graph docs [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/hosted-service/deploy-subgraph-hosted/#create-a-hosted-service-account).
-   Authorize your cli

```bash
graph auth --product hosted-service <ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

## Deploy

```bash
graph deploy --product hosted-service <GITHUB_USER>/<SUBGRAPH NAME>
```

It will take some time for the Graph to sync your subgraph. You can view the progress on the Graph's hosted service dashboard.

## Reference

You can view an example subgraph mapping, schema and subgraph manifest file in this folder. Note that this folder is missing the autogenerated files that the `graph` cli tool generates when you go through the steps above.
